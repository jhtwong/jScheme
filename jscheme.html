Welcome to the jScheme home page.&nbsp; jScheme is a barebone Scheme evaluator
in javascript that can run online on <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape
4.0</A>.&nbsp; This project is the result of a sudden, senseless urge to
do something <I>stupid</I> with a <A HREF="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/spider/cs126/">CPSC
126</A> lab one Saturday morning.&nbsp; And voil&agrave;, here's the
result after two full days of work!

<P>Note: This is a <B>barebone</B> implementation of Scheme, and has only
a <B>handful of primitives</B> and special forms.&nbsp; Note especially
that <B>this evaluator itself is run off an interpreted environment</B>,
and <B>does not optimize tail recursion</B>, so don't expect to live to
see the result of (fib 30000).&nbsp; This also brings up the point that
I <B>haven't implemented big integers</B> in javascript, therefore (fib
30000), when it does come up, is a float.&nbsp; Well, you can see that
you can't really do much with the evaluator as is...... although you can
define macros.

<P>I must give credit to Vincent Manis and Jim Little, coauthors of the
CPSC 126 textbook <A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/little/schematics.html">Schematics
of Computation</A>, who wrote the original code, in Scheme, for the "metacircular
evaluator for Scheme", aka Econo-Scheme.&nbsp; Without it, there wouldn't
be a jScheme (because it's essentially a <I>verbatim</I> port of their
code).

<p>If you want to find out more about Scheme, go to the <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/home.html">Scheme Repository</a>.
<BR>&nbsp;

<p>Oops.&nbsp; Almost forgot:
<h2><a href="testframe.html">Launch jScheme</a></h2>

<h4><b>One final note: If you resize the window once jScheme has loaded, you must reload it, or it will refuse to work!</b></h4>
